"<user> <user> <user> <user> <user> if the emails were hacked by #Putin via #wikileaks why are they even discussed, playing into their hands"
<user> CNN is working to advance Hillary! They are biased!
<user> <user> Unless they decide to up kids in same profession in my view it is horrible choice of profession legalizing it is wrong
<user> Destroy another white guy #christinebrennan is an ugly woman. Inside and out. #feministsareugly
<user> <user> please stop these people when they quote <user>! Its a lie that Hillary talked about <user> HAIR.
<user> don't let the dour hit them in the ass good riddance
<user> For those of you who believe the polls have been honest...
<user> <user> <user> <user> <user> How about it's not that trump wants <user> hurt just wants her & Washington 2 live like us??
"<user> Get used to those stripes, cuz you'll be wearing them soon"
<user> Go tell these kids that have a life now that their seizures are gone that the thing that helps them isnt medicine
<user> Hold up they don't love you like I love you slow down they don't you like I love you.
<user> Hopefully they can determine what exactly happened that led to his shooting. I'm sorry for his family's loss. :'(
"<user>. How many people of color are there? I only see one race of people. Remember, optic are everything right?"
<user> how's third place treating you imbeciles? You are hacks and no one cares what you think or report. You are liars and irrelevant.
"<user> id bet alot of clinton voters want to change their vote, idk why youre pushing this wont help HER"
<user> I do not understand how we the American people do not see the monster he truly is. It's like looking at Adolf Hitler reincarnated.
<user> if someone offered anyone that works there millions of dollars to speak are they going to turn it down
"<user> if you believe in Americas laws and values than you know Donald is right. If there is no penalty, there is no crime"
"<user> I guess they've become accustomed to being lied to! Change is difficult for many, even change for the better!"
<user> I know a lot of people find this funny when it really is not funny. Hormonal changes are bad for both men and women.
<user> I'm a lesbian and I don't give a damn. Why must everyone make a big fucking deal about who they love? What difference does it make?
<user> I'm glad these guys make a good wage. But it baffles the mind as to why they make so much and teachers make 1/2 or less than them.
"<user> I'm tired of this! maybe we (as humans ) don't have the maturity, responsibility, respect, and love of life to be TRUSTED with fire arms"
<user> <user> Ask the white working class guy We R honor driven We R not like U Don't want to B U = Hillary
<user> is notorious for staging bullshit! Y'all have been caught lying probably more then all the other media companies out here put together.
<user> is that why she is repeatedly lying to the American people. What a hypocrite. She would not know the truth if it slapped her face
<user> the movement that helped destroy the black family from within
<user> it's very sad that this country is becoming as equal of a country as a third world. Because of idiots that have no respect for life
"<user> i watch everyday, and so far i hear minimal positives about <user>! Come on stop being unfair about your coverage!"
<user> I will never understand why we can't grasp the concept that we are all one race (human). We are ALL THE SAME! Race isn't a choice.
<user> <user> talking about pay to play and you change the subject to trump?really?Lets stick to the subject not divert from the subject
<user> <user> am I the only one that thinks Obama is smug and don't believe a word that he says he could sit there and bold face lie
<user> like he's going to say yeah we did it! Lol
<user> <user> YES & mentally ill should b separated from rest of society -we r 2 politically correct 2 do it and 2 short on prison space
<user> <user> <user> having illegals afraid of just trying to have a decent life that even their status against the law or not.
<user> <user> we need to keep asking him for his taxes instead of the birther issue in which we already know he lied. We want to see the taxes
<user> <user> but there was no problem when the same election system that voted in our first blk President twice
<user> Of course they do! Do your job and become a real news company!
<user> ok you cant trust what middle schoolers do. Freakin guys in my middle school snorted pixie sticks.
<user> America not worried. Before November Hillary will be in Bellevue barking over & over
<user> and it's Hillary who wants to take away your guns right?
<user> <user> This is the back door battle the republican machine is spending powerful amounts of money to win the office!!
<user> <user> Guess she's planning World War III because WWII WAS the Biggest Jobs Program of that time period.
"<user> <user> Has Trump found a way to blame Hillary yet? He seems to know all about it, kinda suspicious if you ask me."
"<user> <user> <user> America doesn't need a person who is acting like a child, trump is not the solution for this job folks!"
<user> CNN loves this posting! Seems they can't come up with anything better. Time Warner having bad publicity & disgruntled viewers
<user> CNN promting lies and hate - no wonder the country is in ruins - the media is running it.
<user> Damn right. Why do we have to take the trouble makers too? We have our own problems here. We don't need others.
<user> He should - this is very much an issue in the American black community! I take NO OFFENSE so stop characterizing it as such!
<user> <user> Marco Rubio is a two face after all the crap he talks about trump now they are buddies
<user> Instead of deleting gov emails or pleading the 5th? Cnn knows she is corrupt yet u push this BS!
"<user> I owe u $400 M. I say F U. You say, """" I'll cut their heads off if you don't pay up! """" I pay up. Is that a ransom payment? You bet"
"<user> I think no, for what! he is not fixing any thing in there! JA."
<user> just what come one want to have the codes
<user> #LOL nobody kept a copy of those #emails 4 her? #CrookedHillary 4get what w/ in the emails she destroyed? Should of kept the HD
<user> <user> So <user> wants the input from a bunch of morons? Shut up <user> until the election is over!
<user> <user> needs to find more info on <user> taxes. He hasn't paid any taxes since 2000. He's hiding a lot. Why audit?
"<user> <user> Too bad he did not give a better example. He has been delusional about his accomplishments, manipulative and misleading"
<user> Question should be raised is 'what took so long for this email to be disclosed?' Judicial Watch had to go to court for it. WTF!
<user> Sage advice from the Tell it like it is guy Those of us that Love and Trust Hillary knows her Heart and wants America to see it
<user> shame shame shame; In God we trust. Worship the Lord your God and only Him; love your neighbour as yourself. Stop war..
"<user> Still nothing in NYC, NJ and MN terror attacks... cnn staying in the bottom for good reason. CNN working overtime to bury story"
<user> stop white knighting.. no one cares about your opinion
<user> the only way Obama would have a legacy is if he did not support a crook like Hillary
<user> The problem is their schools are sub par run by people that chase after their own betterment not those of the schools
<user> This idiot flip flops on all his so called issues. WISHY WASHY. And he makes no sense at all. HE IS A LOSER.
"<user> Whenever I read the other comments, I need to punch my bag out"
"<user> Why follow his every move?? Where is the news in that? So his plane landed, big deal! Will you follow the motorcade too?"
"<user> yeah we get it, bought and payed 4. Who doesn't own her? Oh yeah American people"
<user> yes cause its all smoke and mirrors to make sure trump answers correctly and does not sound like an idiot
<user> You don't need a header to know it's S or TS info. Any person can make that determination based on the content itself.
"<user> You would think he might want to know what his new CEO thinks & who he associates with before he hires him, wouldn't you?"
<user> POTUS didn't go to Louisiana. What not criticizing him like you did for Bush during Katrina bias reporting again.
CNN reporter apologizes for something she didn't need to apologize for.
<user> Report on Trump owing 3 billion $ in loans 2Russia 4 buildings on USA soil shows in his tax as reported this summer in newspapers
<user> Says the guy who tells Women they should have their body banned in ads. Lmao this hypocrite <user> Also says free speech is bad.
<user> she said she'd do it as senator... and didn't. She full of more lies.
<user> so I'm confused <user> if the hot mic talk was reality then why would ur pig dad call it just locker rm talk? Which is it?
"<user>: stop ur damn lies, if the 2000 election wasn't rigged for Bush then no elections have been rigged. Ur gonna loose dude so man up."
<user> Straight to the point. its only in my country putting criminals in jail is so difficult. Not in the west. I trust justice will be done
<user> tell Mr Sorkin to look at the Trump children and hope that his parenting skills yield those type results!
<user> TEN YEARS???? I wanna escape Trump sooner than that
<user> that beta male needs to shut the fuck up
"<user> The Clinton news network is emotionally upset HC health issues """" BrainDamage """" are being discussed but had no problem when JMcCains was!"
<user> the example tgey are setting for their kida if they have them is well u dont get your way throw a tantrum  burn things yell  scream duh
<user> The hypocrisy from the Clintons and CNN is so thick that you can hear the backfires already coming next Wednesday morning...Trump wins.
<user> Then tell my dog that because she loves paper and shredding it. I show her paper and tell her NO NO. Does she listen? NO NO.
<user> The only faith she knows is lie lie lie and lie some more.
<user> These are the people that chant LOCK HER UP over and over again and they are offended when she calls it like everyone sees it. Ha Ha Ha
"<user> these people have a valid point. This is about water Politicians who don't live here aren't concerned. We all,should be."
"<user> The thing is, people are aware that this is the way you work. They think : CNN is fucking us."
<user> this along with the utter lack of originality is why I never cared for country music - redneck - time to replace him on the voice
"<user> This is no game, Trump is a very dangerous demagogue and your ratings should not be an excuse to allow him a platform."
<user> Trump will never get the african american vote ever mostly because of some of his supporters
<user> we got to stand strong together because it makes the world a better place to live.. Love our world and the people on it
<user> WEST DR CARSON R EVEN HERMAN CAIN & SURE NO BLACK GOP PERSON WE WOULDA HAD 2 YELL @ THEM 2 SHOW SAME AS WHITE WOMAN & DIDNT WANT U 2
<user> what nerve Donald Trump has calling Pennsylvania cheaters! I wouldn't vote for him once never mind five times! Is he paying for votes?
<user> Why does what this one man have to say matter everyday?
<user> why do you feel the need to exploit these children. Their lives aren't something trivial to be used as media
<user> why would you have that fraud who for yrs. tried to pass herself off as black as a panelist? She has no credibility!
<user> You are just trying too hard and still don't get it. #WeAreNotStupid <user> is going to win in a landslide.
<user> You make me laugh at this explanation. With the GPS accuracy available to US FORCES. This is unacceptable
<user> You still don't get it. We are looking for someone who can't fake it.
<user> <user> this is something I need to know how to do!
<user> I got you - you can even ride the bus if you want... We all take lovely naps!

"no, the grass isn't greener on the other side, the grass is only green where you water it"
Nothin better than FGL on these long bus rides
nothing beats laying in bed on a shitty day with lattes while watching pll ☕️ 😍 ❤️
Nothing beats the smell of a freshly cut Christmas tree 🎄
nothing beats the smell of freshly brewed coffee ☕️
Nothing better than being curled up on the couch watching Christmas movies because it's the most wonderful time of the year.
Nothing better than the smell of freshly dyed hair 💙💙💙
Nothing brings a family together like a good ol ' roast.
Nothing brings a family together like a random text from Gramma to her entire contact list that makes no sense to anyone.
Nothing brings our family together quicker than home cooked food. My Seattle family arrives tomorrow and lasagna
Nothing brings you and ya girl together like a pregnancy scare
Nothing compares to a beautiful conversation with a beautiful mind. ❤️
NOTHING COULD RUIN MY MOOD AT THIS POINT IM SO HAPPY IM SO GLAD I BOUGHT ALL OF THOSE COPIES AND STREAMED IT NON STOP I REGRET NOTHING
Nothing for me to do -_-
Nothing for me to do but have one last cry 🎧
Nothing I hate more than a pub full of children. I don't want. To sit. With your children.
Nothing in your social life in high school will ever matter in college so take lots of naps & don't care if you look cool
nothing is more beautiful than when the whole stadium is singing cielito lindo
Nothing is worse than negative people... So ugly.
Nothing is wrong or right in this world.. Everything is relative
"Nothing is wrong with you, he is just a cheater. And he will never stop being a cheater"

nothing like color jet plumes
Nothing like having your own.
"Nothing like the rain, nothing like the rain #MTVStars 5 Seconds Of Summer #ARIAS5SOS 21"
Nothing like the smell of freshly cleaned sheets
"Nothing like waking up, putting on your newest record and falling back asleep #thelumineers #ilovenotworking"
nothing more frustrating than when the aux stops working for no good reason
"Nothing pisses me off more then fake people. If you don't like someone, don't act like you do #AreYouSerious #LikeReally"
Nothing pisses me off more then when people have nothing better to do then criticize people's choices
nothing to do 😴
Nothing to do and I'm not sleepy
Nothing to do a Saturday night what's new?
Nothing worse than a negative nancy trying to ruin other people's happiness
Nothing worse than negative energyy
Nothing worse than negative ppl 😑 - That's right
Nothing worse than surrounding yourself with someone who is negative all the time.
Not in a very happy mood anymore.
not just a coincidence #confirmed
Not knowing how to fight don't make a nigga scary
Not knowing is the worst feeling ever
-- not knowing what vibe we wanted to give off and scrapping entire songs after days of work because they didn't feel right. We are both ---
Not knowing when people are using

"<user> Out of your own mouth you said some foul sh*t about women, and now there are accusers? How stupid are you?!?!"
<user> <user> let it go! You have all the support that's as good as it gets. Not even negative ads could make him feel worse.

<user> Sad news for you :America is great! We do it every day and we will continue to be great without you.
<user> Sad that those heroes would have no voice in the MSM except for you.
<user> saying HRC has mental issues. This coming from a man who has short circuited from day one.

"<user> She can give a good coherent speech, unlike yours. It's just that you only listen when its about you."
"<user> She does NOT want to take away guns, Donald! Stop spreading lies and fear mongering vitriol!"
<user> Shut the hell up you damn loser! You went for a photo op which I think was a big fail idiot the polls are worse for you!
<user> sir the debates are all you should be thinking about.
<user> sit all of the women Bill Clinton raped in the front row!
<user> smiling and waving at the 9-11 Memorial as if it were a campaign rally - HE IS A #GHOUL
"<user> So glad that you continue to out the atrocities that call themselves """" the media """". There day will come"

<user>'s primary sources of pride are things most people try to avoid their entire lives.
<user> State facts. It's a buffet with Mrs. Clinton. Pick a problem my God! You are better than this and you damn well know it!
<user> Stick to the issues or take a chance of Losing the election.
"<user> such a gross piece of shit. You're as pathetic as yr campaign. What in the world is wrong with you, please stop tweeting SMH"
<user> Suggest you make a speech about blatantly biased media - the failure of journalistic ethics. Make it an issue-cite the worst.
"<user> Suggest you use HRC screaming video """" Why am I not 50 points ahead of Trump """" in a clever ad... turn the tables!!!"
"<user> sure thing right after you release your taxes like Hillary and every candidate has done since Nixon, what r u afraid of?"
<user> surprised the Clinton camp of CNN did not blame you for it #trump #Clinton #cnn

<user> Thank you for stepping up for the American people. We need a true leader like you in these tuff times.
<user> thank you!!! Obamacare is killing the middle class my deductible is so high and my payments go up every year
<user> That is legacy of the last republican president who all you republicans conveniently forget about. war cost how much? Hmm
<user> That same epidemic hit Indiana an brought HIV with it Gov Pence could've stopped it earlier but didn't. Great choice for VP
<user> That's because you're mentally ill. Please drop out and seek help.
<user> the audio on the FB live stream mess up some women talking trash about you over your voice just a heads up.
<user> The Campaign is an audition to the American People about your problem solving skill set. Show the people you it.

<user> The Media and Est havent seen anything yet. Our movement is just starting.
<user> The only reason you stopped watching was because they only ever said the truth about you.
<user> The people on subsidies think they will be kicked off Obamacare with no plan under you. What do you tell them? 90% of FL?
<user> : the presidential election version of cicadas : emerging every sixteen-odd years to annoy the hell out of anybody with ears.
<user> the president of the Philippines is threatening war with China over this issue. China is building man made islands.

<user>. THEY HAVE. For someone that is all over the news you are consistently ignorant #factcheck…
"<user> they say you've made the pivot, but I agree with you... it'll never happen. You're now just reading Kellyanne's words."
<user> They show the crowd and sometimes they zoom in close enough to these morons so I could pick them out of a lineup
<user> thinks African-Americans are ignorant - that's his basis for pandering to them now. But he's wrong.
"<user> this from the guy who gets his talking points from what """" some people """" are saying."
"<user> This is why you should not be president. Also, you hate Blacks, so, we won't be voting for you."
<user> This plan is no different than what all presidents claim they will when they get in the #WhiteHouse
"<user> trashing the Media, when the Media built him up! The issue is that a monster was created! <user> #TheLittleMan"
<user> Trump has built up New York City for years He has no financial reasons to serve except to serve
<user> trump I'm seriously worried you need to fuck shit up and fast!
<user> Trump voters don't care how much money he has. We just believe his policies as President will make R lives better.
"<user> Trump, you must send out a message that you do not condone the actions of those who are harassing minorities."
<user> Try community service for illegals that you are going to let stay if they turn themselves in. NO Food Stamps/Welfare/etc

<user> <user> stop your whining election is yours to lose start doing commercials and ppl on the ground y are u waiting
<user> Wait until I put your cock sucker supporters through the Anti-Christ test. The fear will be much harder to manipulate
<user> <user> your secret is you rape women. I don't think any one cares about emails when you are a sexual predator
"<user> We don't need the government to tuck us in and tell us bedtime stories, impose curfews, or infringe our life choices."

<user> why are you telling people to vote GOP? Your against GOP yourself!
<user> why does Donald Trump even go for president? He will destroy our economy. Vote if he should or shouldn't be president.
<user> Why doesnt the media ask why on 10 percent given away from Clinton Foundation a disgrace
<user> why doesnt USA have a health system like our NHS in the Uk? Obamacare is a disaster. Who can afford 25% increase?
<user> Why is no one talking about DJT raping and beating a 13 yrold? He should be in jail. Google and read there is a witness too
"<user> why would anybody want a fake, backstabbing, racist person as their president? You need some new PR people"
<user>  Why would you use Bobby Jindal he destroyed our Charity Hospitals tried to close SU. Bad move for middle class and Poor

<user>  yes u will make it in the hell 👎
<user> yes we are. So many people at the rally. Amazing
"<user> Yes you are. I canceled our local newspaper, called and told them why."
<user> you addressed the lack of common sense spending of tax dollars. Please include more of this in your rallies.
<user> You are as predictable as the pus&sy in the 8th grade with a big mouth that isn't showing up at the fight after school
<user> you aren't <user> quit trying to be. You can say his words but they ring hollow from a racist blowhard like you
<user> You are one crazy scare me. I am not younger I am a 61 years old who knows crazy when she sees it
<user> You are rambling again... maybe you need to get that checked by a real doctor.
<user> you are signing up your own election observers? Voter intimidation mean anything to you? <user> put an end to this mess
<user> You are the biggest LIAR that has ever run for office. A terrible role model for young people. Do not underestimate Hillary
<user> You are the only one that will help the middle class. You're the only one that lowers taxes and will create jobs.
<user> You are the only presidential candidate I've been eager to vote for and to see in office.
<user> You can't do that because it will expose children to preventable disease.
<user> You can't repeal it without a supermajority in Congress you fucking dummy!
<user> you caved in for people that will never support you. They get what they want then they call you a flip-flopper.
<user> You constantly dodge questions! Why? Because you are ignorant and have no idea what's real and what you've made up.
"<user> you disgusting fucking asshole. Couldn't wait to exploit the death of someone's child, could you? You suck at being human."
<user> you do not have to raise taxes if we quit spending wastefully and get back on budget. As a SS recipient I cut back to live
<user> you gonna have to spend some of that money. I'm voting for you in November. Get them adds out Can't rely on donations alone
<user> you keep sticking your foot in your mouth. Let's be honest here.
<user> You managed to lose many Latino voters though. thankful that the diversity vote is smart enough to see through Don the Con
<user> You must explain how you are going to deal with the Rio Grande River which is a shared U. S. border with Mexico! Forgot it?
"<user> You must think if you say it enough it will just automatically come true. Mexico isn't paying for a fucking wall, dumbass."
<user> you need to read Matthew 12:25-26. a house divide against it self can not stand. you need the republican to win.
<user> your a clown trump you are so low end pathetic piece of garbage
<user> you're a joke and a big dummy. A lot of people are saying that.
<user> your economic policy is a joke. You're a hack and a disgrace
"<user> You're not even a republican, can't believe you've conned so many.. Really well done! You must be laughing Ur ass off."
<user> You're not gonna win. I don't get why you just won't give up already. You're making America and yourself look like fools.
<user> Your failure will be the best news that every other nation could possibly get. IT MUST GET WORSE BEFORE IT GETS BETTER.
<user> your going to get your tail beat America is great
"<user> your peeps sure are scared you'll be fact check Monday night. Could they know you lie, lie, lie, ALOT!"
<user> Your strategy to include minorities is great. Please make it genuine by taking it to inner cities and churches.
<user> You say you will do everything you say you will do. When is this supposed to begin? It's not really your style. You lie.
<user> You should remove your cap when you address a crowd. It shades your eyes ; revealing your eyes communicates honesty.
<user> you wanna make America great how about helping out homeless vets
<user> You will lose this election by your own doing!
<user> you will never fix this system and you just want to votes to win the election
<user> You will never identify with minorities. You spent a year being disrespectful and NOW you want our votes @ crunch time!
<user> <user> how so? What part of prep school and silver spoons make you think the don knows what its like to skip meals?
